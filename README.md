# Top-Universities-Analysis
Problem Statement: Higher education institutions play a crucial role in shaping future leaders and innovators. This project aims to analyze university ranking data to uncover insights about the best institutions globally and regionally.



## Introduction:
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the global university rankings dataset. It explores how factors such as research output, education quality, alumni employment, and faculty strength influence university rankings. The goal is to identify trends, determine contributing factors, and examine the ranking progression over time.
## Data Overview:
The dataset contains information about global university rankings including features such as university name, country, year, overall score, rank, and several academic indicators like Citations, Publications, Faculty Quality, and Alumni Employment. This dataset forms the foundation for analysis to understand institutional performance and global academic standing.
## 1. Data Preparation:
The dataset was loaded using pandas from a CSV file. Data types were checked using df.info() and df.dtypes. Missing values were handled appropriately, and numerical columns like 'Rank' and 'Score' were converted to numeric types using pd.to_numeric().
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Initial exploration involved viewing the top rows using df.head(), retrieving column names using df.columns, and identifying the distribution of universities using value_counts(). The dataset structure was reviewed to understand the available features.
## 3. Top Universities Analysis:
Top-ranked universities were identified using sort_values() on the 'Rank' or 'Score' column. The most frequent top performers were extracted using head() to display the leading institutions globally.
## 4. Country Performance:
value_counts() was used to evaluate how many top universities each country has. groupby() combined with count() and mean() helped analyze the number and average scores of universities per country. Filtering universities with Rank <= 100 allowed for comparison among top-performing nations.
## 5. Factor Analysis:
The corr() function was used to identify factors that most strongly correlate with overall university scores. scatterplot() was used to visualize how research-oriented metrics such as Citations, Publications, Broad Impact, and other academic indicators like Faculty Quality and Alumni Employment relate to the overall score.
## 6. Trend Analysis:
groupby() was used to evaluate ranking trends over time by grouping data by university and year. The pivot() function restructured the data for better year-wise comparison. Finally, heatmap() provided a clear visual representation of how university rankings changed over time.
## Conclusion:
This analysis involved a range of Python functions including sort_values(), value_counts(), groupby(), mean(), corr(), scatterplot(), pivot(), and heatmap() to explore global university rankings. These tools helped identify key ranking factors, top-performing countries and institutions, and patterns over time.
